# My Unison Test App

Just playing around with [The Unison language](https://github.com/unisonweb/unison)

POC Http server

Yes it works. Check scratch.u for example that responds 200 Hello! for all paths.

Working on making http package with server and client in [Nipsuli/unisonhttp](https://github.com/Nipsuli/unisonhttp).
